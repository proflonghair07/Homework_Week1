Project Description

1. Changed title from Website to Horiseon.
2. Changed all the div tags to semantic html tags.  More specifically <header> and <footer> tags were added.  In the links portion of the page divs were changed to <nav> tags.  The div tag containing the background was changed to a <figure> tag.  Added a <main> tag and changed the three divs within it to <article> tags.  Changed the div containg the side column to an <aside> and changed the divs contained inside it to <section> tags.
3. Added descriptive alt attributes to all the img tags.  For the figure tag used use role and aria-label to add an alt to the background image.
4. Replaced the h2 in the footer section with an h4 to ensure that h tags were all in sequential order.  Created an h4 selector with a font-size of 20px to retain the original font-size of the element.
5. Consolidated all of the css.  Removed almost all class selectors and changed to tag selectors now that all the divs had been changed to unique tags.  This made much less code in the css as many of the classes were redundant.
6. Fixed the Search Engine Optimization link in the nav-bar.
7. Commented the html in a way that makes it clear where the different portions of the page are located in the code.
8. Reorganized all the selectors in the css file to be grouped together in groups that reflect how they are used in the css.  Commented the css in a way that seperated the groups of selectors into their different counterparts.
9. Added four additional meta tags. Added viewport to assure website appeared good on all screen sizes, added Author to attribute the page to Horiseon, added description meta tag to describe what the page is, and added keyword metadata to help make the page reachable from search engines.
